Upon leaving, I returned to school to finish my degree.\nTo pursue the activities I care about, I went to Bali to earn my Divemaster certification. I spend six weeks working for Bali Crystal Divers, learning, teaching, and leading dives around Bali.\nWork/life balance is very important to me, and I carried that into my academic career. I spend much of my time planning travel and visting to other contries. I enjoy seeing new spaces and meeting people I wouldn’t otherwise meet. I’ve seen some incredible spaces, my favorite so far, the south island of New Zealand."
