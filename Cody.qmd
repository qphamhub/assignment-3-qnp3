## 

-   From the years of 2012 to 2021, I was enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as an infantryman. I went on three deployments: the Balkans, the South Pacific, and the Middle East. Upon leaving, I returned to school to finish my degree.

-   To pursue the activities I care about, I went to Bali to earn my Divemaster certification. I spend six weeks working for Bali Crystal Divers, learning, teaching, and leading dives around Bali.

-   Work/life balance is very important to me, and I carried that into my academic career. I spend much of my time planning travel and visting to other contries. I enjoy seeing new spaces and meeting people I wouldn't otherwise meet. I've seen some incredible spaces, my favorite so far, the south island of New Zealand.
